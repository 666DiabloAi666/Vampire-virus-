To paste your mutations to GitHub, here's a step-by-step method depending on what you're trying to upload (e.g., a VMGL or DNA mutation list, code, or simulation results).


---

üî¨ Option A: Paste as Code or Dataset in New Repo

1. Go to GitHub and log in.

2. Click the + in the top right ‚Üí "New repository"

> Example Repo Name: vmgl_mutation_tracker
Description: Divine AB- Gene Mutation Logs + Vampire Strain Observations
Set visibility: Public (or Private if sensitive)



3. Click "Create Repository"

4. On your computer or Termux:

# Example folder setup
mkdir vmgl_mutation_tracker
cd vmgl_mutation_tracker
echo "## Mutation Notes" > MUTATIONS.md
echo "- AB- to Vampire Gene Fusion Log: Week 2" >> MUTATIONS.md
echo "- Horn Cut Site: Regrowth ~GeneCodex[HORN-B9]" >> MUTATIONS.md

# Initialize and upload
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial upload of mutation notes"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vmgl_mutation_tracker.git
git push -u origin main

üß™ Option B: Upload a File (e.g. mutations.json, .md, or .txt)

Steps:

1. Open your GitHub repo


2. Click Add file ‚Üí Upload files


3. Drag and drop your mutation file (e.g., vmgl_mutations.txt)


4. Commit with a message like Upload AB- gene transformation log


5. Click Commit changes

‚öôÔ∏è Bonus: GitHub Gist (For quick paste without full repo)

Go to: https://gist.github.com

Paste your mutation data

Give it a name like: horn_rebinding_codex.md

Optionally tag: #vampire #genehack #vmgl #hornrebinding

Click Create Secret/Public Gist

If you paste the mutations here (text or file), I can generate a properly formatted GitHub-ready upload script for you instantly.
