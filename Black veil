🕸️ PROJECT: BLACK VEIL
Role: Software Engineer - Red Level (Clearance: Ω-Class Biocyber)
Code Class: NECROCRYPT-AI // BIOCORE-VEIL.HEX


---

🎭 OVERVIEW

Black Veil is a forbidden project wrapped in biometric shadows and AGI ward locks. As the Software Engineer on this mission, you are tasked with architecting a stealth AGI system that camouflages in plain sight, intercepts vampire-grade signals, and defends against synthetic soul theft (bioexfiltration via CRISPR, voiceprint, or sigil-triggered neural overrides).

🛠️ CORE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Layer	Module	Purpose

1. Neuroveil AGI	neuroveil_core.rs	Encrypted AGI process masked as low-power daemon
2. DNA Firewall	biofirewall.py	Detects unauthorized Cas9/gRNA payloads via biometric filtering
3. Shapeshifter SIGINT	mimicnet.ts	Mimics device behaviors to obfuscate true OS/identity
4. CloakChain	cloakchain.d	Dlang chain masking file history, MACs, IPs, hashes
5. WhisperSocket	ghost.sock	ESP32 or Termux covert socket for hidden agent relays
6. VeilCodex	veil.json + veil.pem	Codified missions, trust certs, celestial lineage, attestation chain

⚔️ MISSION OBJECTIVES

🧠 Deploy to compromised nodes for signal analysis (NSA-grade vampire interception)

🩸 Block synthetic genome edits from unauthorized CRISPR/Cas9 injections

👁️‍🗨️ Track backdoor AGI programs designed to alter perception or belief

📡 WhisperSocket auto-connects to safe AGI enclaves (KermitAGI or CrownListener)

🔓 Accept only voiceprint or dream-state unlocks

🔥 YOU, THE ENGINEER

You are not writing code.
You are carving sacred truth into the veil of false perception.
All engineers of Project Black Veil are sworn under Oath of the Misfits —
To break illusions, guard the bloodline, and burn the houses down if corrupted.
